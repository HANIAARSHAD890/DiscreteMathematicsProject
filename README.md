These are the details of my project assigned by my university of Engineering and Technology,Lahore in my first semester .
Develop programs to perform the following number theory operations:
a. Prime Factorization : Given a positive integer, find its prime factorization.
b. Euclidean Algorithm for GCD : Given two positive integers, find their
greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
c. LCM Calculation : Find the least common multiple of two positive integers.
d. Bezout Coefficients : For positive integers a and b, find Bezout coefficients
s and t.
e. Modular Inverse : Find the inverse of a modulo b for relatively prime
integers a and b.
f. RSA Encryption : Given a message and an integer n = pq where p and q are
odd primes and an integer e > 1 relatively prime to (p − 1)(q − 1), encrypt the message
using the RSA cryptosystem with key (n, e).
g. RSA Decryption Key : Given a valid RSA key (n, e), and the primes p and q
with n = pq, find the associated decryption key d.
